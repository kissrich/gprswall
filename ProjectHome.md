GUI frontend for iptables to accept/reject gprs/edge/3G traffic on Android devices. Required installed commands 'su' and 'iptables'.

Why - some operators (russian Beeline) can establish internet gprs session even with wrong APN, and with expensive payment WAP-GPRS, so it's impossible to disable gprs with applications like [apndroid](http://code.google.com/p/apndroid/).
